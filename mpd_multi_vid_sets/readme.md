lowest_first.mpd contains two video adaption sets

The first has a low quality Representation
The seconds has better quality Representations

Currently IA on AUTO will just select the first set and use representations from that.
Ideally we would want IA to select the set which contains the highest representation

highest_first.mpd has the order of the sets reversed and we get the current behaviour
